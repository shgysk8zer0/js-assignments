> This will teach you what real coding is like. Unlike other resources, this will
> teach you how to edit code inside of an editor instead of in a browser. You will
> learn modern practices, such as ECMAScript classes and modules, and how to use
> what you have learned to do pretty much anything you can imagine online.

> These lessons are for the determined only. This is for those who wish to teach
> themselves. You will be spending a lot of time on [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/)
and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). This is not where you come to
> learn jQuery. This will teach you how to write something that will kick jQuery's
> ass!
