## Introduction
> This will teach you what real coding is like. Unlike other resources, this will
> teach you how to edit code inside of an editor instead of in a browser. You will
> learn modern practices, such as ECMAScript classes and modules, and how to use
> what you have learned to do pretty much anything you can imagine online.

> These lessons are for the determined only. This is for those who wish to teach
> themselves. You will be spending a lot of time on [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/)
and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). This is not where you come to
> learn jQuery. This will teach you how to write something that will kick jQuery's
> ass!

## Requirements
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Browser with JavaScript modules support. E.g. [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/)
- Code editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io)
- [NPM / NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- :coffee: Coffee
